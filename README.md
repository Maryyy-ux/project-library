This site is for my syster. She is an awesome newly writer and I want to encourage her to pursue her dreams.She is always supporting me, my mom and her friends, forgetting about her.  
Those are spiring books for her (somehow). The empty space is for her next book. 
The aim of this page is to be the frame for her's future books. 

Go for it!!!
